                <ol>
                    <!-- <li>Cut one of the onions in half.</li>
                    <li>Take on half of the onion and slice it 
                        into strips from above.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat the above step with the other half of 
                        the onion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with the other onion.</li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with each of the tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tsp of olive oil to a wok and raise it to medium 
                        heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you can feel heat radiating above the 
                        wok, add the onions to the pan and shift them around 
                        with the wooden spoon until softened and lightly 
                        browned--should take 3-5 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Now, add the tomatoes and continue to stir for another 
                        minute, then add a drizzle of soy sauce, a teaspoon or a few 
                        grinder-rotations of pepper, and a teaspoon of salt.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li> -->
