            <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>Sacrilege of a Chinese recipe I found in Fuschia 
                Dunlop's <em>Every Grain of Rice: Simple Chinese 
                Home Cooking</em>.</p>
                <p>This recipe is quick and easy and uses few 
                    ingredients.</p>
            <!-- <h2>Utensils:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wok</li>
                    <li>Wooden spoon/other piece of cutlery that won't 
                        degrade your wok's non-stick coating
                    </li>
                    <li>Knife</li>
                </ul> -->
            <h2>Ingredients (2 Meals):</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 large onion</li>
                    <li>1 large tomato</li>
                    <li>2 spring onions</li>
                    <li>2 medium-sized eggs</li>
                    <li>150g cooked rice (that has been refrigerated overnight or is 
                        in a microwaveable rice pouch)
                    </li>
                    <li>Olive oil</li>
                    <li>Soy sauce</li>
                    <li>Black pepper</li>
                    <li>Sesame oil</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut one of the onions in half.</li>
                    <li>Take one half of the onion and slice it 
                        into strips from above.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat the above step with the other half of 
                        the onion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with the other onion.</li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with each of the tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>Slice the spring onions into short cylinders, grouping together the 
                        green-leafy parts and the white-onion parts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Crack the eggs and empty their contents into the same bowl.</li>
                    <li>With the egg whisk, beat the contents of the bowl until 
                        consistent mixed thoroughly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add 2 tsp of olive oil to a wok and raise it to medium 
                        heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you can feel heat radiating above the 
                        wok, pour in the egg mixture. When its edges have begun to 
                        solidify, using the wooden spoon, draw from the edge of the 
                        egg disc to its centre, allowing mixture that hasn't touched 
                        the wok to set too; do the same from the other side of the egg 
                        disk, too.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once most of the egg has begun to set, use the wooden spoon to roughly 
                        cut the egg into bite-size pieces, stir the egg until no more 
                        liquid mixture can be seen, then empty the egg back into the bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add another 2 tsp of olive oil to the wok followed by the onions and shift them around 
                        with the wooden spoon until softened and lightly 
                        browned--should take 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Now, add the tomatoes, egg and white-onion parts of the spring onions and continue to 
                        stir for another 2 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Raise heat to medium-high, pour in the rice and stir until it is hot.</li>
                    <li>Stir in a drizzle of soy sauce and 1 tsp of sesame oil.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately with the green-leafy parts of the spring onions and some black pepper 
                        on top and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
