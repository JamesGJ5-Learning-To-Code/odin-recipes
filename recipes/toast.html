            <!-- <h2>Steps:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <!-- <li>Cut one of the onions in half.</li>
                    <li>Take one half of the onion and slice it 
                        into strips from above.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat the above step with the other half of 
                        the onion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with the other onion.</li>
                    <li>Repeat all above steps with each of the tomatoes.</li>
                    <li>Crack the eggs and empty their contents into the same bowl.</li>
                    <li>With the egg whisk, beat the contents of the bowl until 
                        consistent mixed thoroughly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add 2 tsp of olive oil to a wok and raise it to medium 
                        heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>When you can feel heat radiating above the 
                        wok, pour in the egg mixture. When its edges have begun to 
                        solidify, using the wooden spoon, draw from the edge of the 
                        egg disc to its centre, allowing mixture that hasn't touched 
                        the wok to set too; do the same from the other side of the egg 
                        disk, too.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once most of the egg has begun to set, use the wooden spoon to roughly 
                        cut the egg into bite-size pieces, stir the egg until no more 
                        liquid mixture can be seen, then empty the egg back into the bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add another 2 tsp of olive oil to the wok followed by the onions and shift them around 
                        with the wooden spoon until softened and lightly 
                        browned--should take 3-5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Now, add the tomatoes and egg and continue to stir for another 
                        2 minutes, then add a drizzle of soy sauce, and a teaspoon or a few 
                        grinder-rotations of black pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li> -->
